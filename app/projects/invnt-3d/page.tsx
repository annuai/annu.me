        Low-cost 3D printers are often badly designed in terms of usability to non-technical consumers. The project looks into development of a product for new enthusiasts interested in 3D printing without much technical knowledge, providing them a kickstart with a simple thoughtfully designed 3D printer.
        <span className="font-bold block mt-3">Problem Statement</span>
    How do we design and develop a versatile 3D printer platform with the less technically acquainted user in mind? How can the Indian context be put into the idea of the machine. What is the scope of the audience for such machines in India and how can design be used to better cater to their requirements?

        A 3D printer will soon become a household appliance. Today, they are machines that look and feel right out of a sci-fi movie - very complex in their appearance and mostly complex with their working and assembly as well. User-centric design can solve many of the problems of these printers. There is a market that would potentially buy 3D printers just like how they adapted inkjets and laser printers. Designing the printer that resolves the idea of printing objects for the naive individual will always be the ultimate goal of a consumer 3D printer design.

  <div className="font-bold mt-2">Technical Drawings/ Engineering Drawings</div>
  <div className="">
    Learnt how to create technical drawings for manufacturable parts.
  </div>
  <div className="font-bold mt-2">Learning new processes</div>
  <div className="">
    Processes other than 3D printing has been used widely in the project. Powder Coating, Tapping & Threading - all processes I had to explore to get the prototype up and running. 3D printing made this project possible - learning how to 3D print strong objects with less filament has also been a key learning in the project.
  </div>
  <div className="font-bold mt-2">Time management</div>
  <div className="">
    A lot of work has been done in a short amount of time. The project had a fixed timeline of 4 months initially, but it eventually grew onto 6 and then another month of documentation. Time management is a difficult task - especially when the dependency is on external factors. Planning must be done by considering external factors like logistics and processes.
  </div>
  <div className="font-bold mt-2">Purchase management</div>
  <div className="">
    As a self-sponsored project, there were a lot of constraints on how much money can be spent. Few original calculation errors lead to multiple purchases of similar components causing an unnecessary hike in the overall budget.
